\begin{enumerate}
\item  Find the value of $x$ such that the points $A\brak{3,2,1}, B\brak{4, x, 5}, C\brak{4,2,-2}$ and $D\brak{6,5,-1}$ are coplanar.
\item The x-coordinate of a point on the line joining the points $P\brak{2, 2, 1}$and $Q\brak{5, 1,–2}$  is $4$. Find its z-coordinate.
\item Find the distance between the planes $2x - y + 2z = 5$ and $5x - 2.5y + 5z = 20$ .
\item Find the coordinates of the point where the line through the points $\brak{3, – 4, – 5}$ and $\brak{2, – 3, 1}$, crosses the plane determined by the points $\brak{1, 2, 3}, \brak{4, 2, – 3}$ and $\brak{0, 4, 3}$ .
