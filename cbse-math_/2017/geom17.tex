\begin{enumerate}
\item $AB$ is the diameter of a circle and $C$ is any point on the circle. Show that the area of triangle $ABC$ is maximum, when it is an isosceles triangle.
\item A variable plane which remains at a constant distance $3p$ from the origin cuts the coordinate axes at $A, B, C$ . Show that the locus of the centroid of triangle $ABC$ is $\dfrac{1}{x^2} + \dfrac{1}{y^2} + \dfrac{1}{z^2} = \dfrac{1}{p^2}$ .

\item Show that the surface area of a closed cuboid with square base and given volume is minimum, when it is a cube .
\item Find the area enclosed between the parabola $4y = 3x^2$ and the straight line $3x â€“ 2y + 12 = 0$ .
