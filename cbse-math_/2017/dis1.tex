\item If the ratio of the sum of the first n terms of two A.Ps is $\brak{7n + 1}$ : $\brak{4n + 27}$, then find the ratio of their $9^{th}$ terms.
\item For what value of n, are the $n^{th}$ terms of two A.Ps $63,65,67,$\ldots and $3,10,17,$\ldots equal?
\item How many terms of an A.P. $9,17,254,$\ldots must be taken to a given a sum of $636$?
