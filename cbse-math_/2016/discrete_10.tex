\begin{enumerate}
\item For what value of $k$ will $k+9, 2k-1$ and $2k+7$ are the consecutive terms of an A.P ?\\
\item  The $4$th term of an A.P. is zero. Prove that the $25$th term of the A.P. is three times its $11$th term.\\
\item  If the ratio of the sum of first $n$ terms of two A.P's is $\brak{7n + 1} : \brak{4n + 27}$, find the ratio of their $m$ th terms.\\
\item The sums of first $n$ terms of three arithmetic progressions are $S_1, S_2$ and $S_3$ respectively. The first term of each A.P. is $1$ and their common differences are $1, 2$ and $3$ respectively. Prove that $S_1+S_3=S_2$.\\
\item The digits of a positive number of three digits are in A.P. and their sum is $15$.The number obtained by reversing the digits is $594$ less than the original number. Find the number.\\
\item The houses in a row are numbered consecutively from $1$ to $49$. Show that there exists a value of $X$ such that sum of numbers of houses preceeding the house numbered $X$ is equal to sum of the numbers of houses following $X$.
