\item The length of the shadow of a tower on the plane ground is $\sqrt{3}$ times the height of the tower.Find the angle of elevation of the sun.

\hfill\brak{10, 2023}\item  The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point on the ground which is $30$ m away from the foot of the tower,is $30\degree$ .Find the height of the tower.

\hfill\brak{10, 2023}\item  As observed from the top of a $75$ m high lighthouse from the sea-level,the angles of depression of two ships are $30\degree$ and $60\degree$.If one ship is exactly behind the other on the same side of the lighthouse,find the distance between two ships.$\brak{Use \sqrt{3} = 1.73}$

\hfill\brak{10, 2023}\item  From a point on the ground,the angle of elevation of the bottom and top of a transmission tower fixed at the top of $30$ m high building are $30\degree$ and $60\degree$, respectively.Find the height of the transmission tower.$\brak{Use \sqrt{3} = 1.73}$
