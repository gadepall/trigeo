	\item $PQ$ is a tangent to a circle with centre $\vec{O}$ at the point $\vec{P}$ on the circle. If $\triangle OPQ$ is an isosceles triangle, then find $\angle OQP$.
	\item Two concentric circles have radii $10 cm$ and $6 cm$. Find the length of the chord of the larger circle which touches the smaller circle.
	\item If tangents $PA$ and $PB$ from an external point $\vec{P}$ to a circle with centre $\vec{O}$ are inclined to each other at an angle of 70\degree, then find $\angle POA$.
