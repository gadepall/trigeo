	\hfill\brak{10, 2021}\item To explain how trignometry can be used measure the height of an inaccessible object, a teacher gave the following example to students :

		A TV tower stands vertically n the bank of a canal. From a point on the other bank direct opposite the tower, the angle of the elevation of the top of the tower is $60\degree$.From another point 20 m away from this point to the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is $30\degree$ (as shown in Figure 1).
