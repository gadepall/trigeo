	\item A firm knows that the demand function for one of its product is linear. It also knows that it can sell $1400$ units when the price is \rupee{4} per unit and it can sell $1800$ units at a price \rupee{2} per unit.Find the marginal revenue function of this product.

\item Find the intervals in which the function $f(x) = x^{4}–4x^{3}+6x^{2}–4x+1$ is increasing or decreasing.

\item If $\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+\sqrt{1-y^{2}}=4(x-y)$,then show that $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\sqrt{1-y^{2}}}{\sqrt{1-x^{2}}}$.


\item If $f'(x)=3x^{2}-4x-\frac{2}{x^{3}}$ and $f(1)=0$, then find $f(2)$.
