\begin{enumerate}
\item Two dice are thrown simultaneously. The probability that the sum of two numbers appearing on the top of the dice is less than $12$, is
 \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\frac{1}{36}$
        \item $\frac{35}{36}$
        \item $0$
        \item $1$
    \end{enumerate}

\item A jar contains $18$ marbles. Some are red and others are yellow. If a 
marble is drawn at random from the jar, the probability that it is red is $\frac{2}{3}$. Find the number of yellow marbles in the jar.
    \end{enumerate}
