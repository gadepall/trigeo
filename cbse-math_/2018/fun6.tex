\item Check whether the relation $R$ defined on the set $A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ as $R = \{\brak{a, b} : b = a + 1\}$ is reflexive, symmetric, or transitive.
\item Let $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow Y$ be a function defined as $f\brak{x} = 4x + 3$,
where $Y = \{y \in \mathbb{N} : y = 4x + 3, \text{ for some } x \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Show that $f$ is invertible. Find its inverse.
\item Examine whether the operation $*$ defined on $\mathbb{R}$, the set of all real numbers, by $a*b$=${\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$ is a binary operation or not, and if it is a binary operation, find whether it is associative or not.
