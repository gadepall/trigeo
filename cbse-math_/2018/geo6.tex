\item Show that the height of the cylinder of  maximum volume that can be inscribed in a sphere of radius $R$ is $\dfrac{2R}{\sqrt{3}}$. Also find the maximum volume.
\item Using the method of integration, find the area of the triangle whose vertices are $\brak{1,0}$, $\brak{2,2}$ and $\brak{3,1}$.
\item Using the method of integration, find the area of the region enclosed between two circles $ {x}^2 + {y}^2 = 4$ and  $ \brak{x-2}^2 + {y}^2 = 4$.
\item The volume of a cube is increasing at the rate of $8 cm^3/s$. How fast is the surface area increasing when the length of its edge is $12 cm$ ?
\item Using integration, find the area of the triangular region whose sides have the equations ${y}={2x}+{1}$,${y}={3x}+1$ and $x =4$.
