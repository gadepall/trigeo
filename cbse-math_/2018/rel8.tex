
\item If $f(x) = x + 1$, find $\frac{d}{dx}\brak{f \circ f}\brak{x}$
	   \item Examine whether the operation $*$ defined on R by $a * b = ab + 1$ $\brak{i}$is a binary operation.$\brak{ii}$ If a binary operation, is it associative or not?

            \item prove that the function$f:N \rightarrow N$,defined by $f(x)=x^2+x+1$ is one-one but not onto.Find the inverse of $f:N\rightarrow S$,where S is range of f.


\item Show that the relation $R$ on ${R}$ defined as $R =\cbrak{{{\brak{a, b} : a \leq b}}}$, is reflexive, and transitive but not symmetric.
