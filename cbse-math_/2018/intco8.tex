\item Using integration, find the area of triangle ABC, whose vertices are A$\brak{2, 5}$, B$\brak{4, 7}$ and C$\brak{6, 2}$.
\item Find the area of the region lying above x-axis and included between the circle $x^2+y^2 = 8x$ and inside of the parabola $ y^2 = 4x$
\item Prove that the curves $y^2 = 4x$ and $x^2 = 4y$ divide the area of the square bounded by sides $x=0,x=4,y=4,$ and $y=0$ into three equal parts.
\item Using integration, find the area of the triangle whose vertices are $\brak{2,3},\brak{3,5}$ and $\brak{4,4}$
\item Find the equation of tangent to the curve $y=\sqrt{3x-2}$ which is parallel to the line $4x-2y+5=0$.and Also write the equation of the normal to the curve at the contact.
