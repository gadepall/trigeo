\item If $P\brak{not A} =0.7, P\brak{B}=0.7$ and $P\brak{B\mid A}=0.5$, then find $P\brak{A\mid B}$.
\item A coin is tossed $5$ times. What is the probability of getting 
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
		\item $3$ heads,
		\item at most $3$ heads ?
	\end{enumerate}	
 \item Find the probability distribution of $X$, the number of heads in a simultaneous toss of two coins.
\item There are three coins. One is a two-headed coin, another is a biased coin that comes up heads $75 \%$ of the time and the third is an unbiased coin. One of the three coins is chosen at random and tossed. If it shows heads, what is the probability that it is the two-headed coin ?
