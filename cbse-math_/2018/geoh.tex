\begin{enumerate}

\item  Show that the height of a cylinder, which is open at the top, having a given surface area and greatest volume, is equal to the radius of its base.
 



\item An isosceles triangle of vertical angle $2\theta$ is inscribed in a circle of radius $a$. show that the area of the triangle is maximum when $\theta=\dfrac{\pi}{6}$.

\item Find the co-ordinates of the point, where the line $\dfrac{x+2}{1}=\dfrac{y-5}{3}=\dfrac{z+1}{5}$ cuts the yz-plane.

\item Prove that the radius of the right circular cylinder of greatest curved surface area which can be inscribed in a given cone is half of that of the cone.
