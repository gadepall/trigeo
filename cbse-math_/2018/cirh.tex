\begin{enumerate}

\item The sum of the perimeters of circle and a square is $\text{K}$, where $\text{K}$ is some constant. Prove that the sum of their areas is least when the side of the square is twice the radius of the circle.

\item Find the equations of the tangent and normal to the curve $y = \frac{x - 7}{\brak{x - 2}\brak{x - 3}}$ at the point where it cuts the x-axis.
