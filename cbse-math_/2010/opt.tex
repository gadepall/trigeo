\begin{enumerate}

\item One kind of cake requires 300g of flour and 15g of fat, another kind of cake requires 150g of flour and 30g of fat. Find the maximum number of cakes which can be made from 7.5kg of flour and 600g of fat, assuming that there is no shortage of the other ingredients used in making the cakes. Make it as an LPP and solve it graphically.
