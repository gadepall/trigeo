\hfill\brak{10, 2020}\item A statue $1.6m$ tall, stands on the top of a pedestal. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of the statue is $60\degree$ and from the same point the angle of elevation of the top of the pedestal is $45\degree$. Find the height of the pedestal.(Use $\sqrt{3}=1.73$)
