\begin{enumerate}
\item Check whether the relation $R$ defined on the set $A=\cbrak{1,2,3,4,5,6}$ as $R =\cbrak {(a, b) : b = a + 1}$ is reflexive, symmetric or transitive.

\item Let $f$ : $N\rightarrow Y $ be a function defined as $f\brak{x}= 4x + 3$, where $Y=\cbrak{y\in N:y=4x+3, \text{ for some } x\in N}$. Show that $f$ is invertible. Find its inverse.

\item Examine whether the operation $*$ defined on $\vec{R}$, the set of all real numbers, by $a * b = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ is a binary operation or not, and if it is a binary operation, find whether it is associative or not.

\item Let $A= R - \{2\}$ and $B = R - \{1\}$. If $f : A \rightarrow B$ is a function defined by $f\brak{x}=\frac{x-1}{x-2}$, show that $f$ is one-one and onto. Hence, find $f^{-1}$.

\item Show that the relation $S$ in the set $A = \{x \in Z : 0  \le x  \le 12\}$ given by $S= \{\brak{a, b} : a, b \in Z, a-b $ is divisible by $ 3 $ \} is an equivalence relation.
