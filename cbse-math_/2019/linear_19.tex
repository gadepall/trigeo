\begin{enumerate}
\item Using integration, find the area of the region bounded by the parabola $y^{2}=4x$ and the circle $4x^{2}+4y^{2}=9$.

\item Using the method of integration, find the area of the region bounded by the lines $3x - 2y + 1 = 0, 2x + 3y - 21 = 0$ and $x - 5y + 9 = 0$.


\item Using integration, find the area of the region bounded by the line
$y = 3x + 2,$ the x-axis and the ordinates $x = - 2$ and $x = 1$.

\item Using integration, find the area of the smaller region bounded by the ellipse $\frac{x^{2}}{9}+\frac{y^{2}}{4}=1$ and the line $\frac{x}{3}+\frac{y}{2}=1$.
