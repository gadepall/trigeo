\item $A$ company manufactures two types of novelty souvenirs made of plywood. Souvenirs of type $A$ require $5$ minutes each for cutting and $10$ minutes each for assembling. Souvenirs of type $B$ require $8$ minutes each for cutting and $8$ minutes each for assembling. There are $3$ hours and $20$ minutes available for cutting and $4$ hours available for  assembling. The profit is \rupee $50$ each for type $A$ and \rupee $60$  each for type $B$ souvenirs. How many souvenirs of each type should the company manufacture in order to maximize profit ? Formulate the above LPP and solve it graphically and also find the maximum profit .

\item Find the local maxima and local minima, if any, of the following function. Also find the local maximum and the local minimum values, as the case may be :
\begin{align*}
    f\brak{x}=\sin x + \dfrac{1}{2} \cos 2x,0\leq x \leq \dfrac{\pi}{2}.
\end{align*}
