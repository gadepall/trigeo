\item A bag contains $5$ red and $3$ black balls and another bag contain $2$ red and $6$ black balls. Two balls are drawn at random (without replacement) from one of the bags an both are found to be red. Find the probability that balls are drawn from the first bag.                 
\item A card from a pack of $52$  playing cards is lost. From the remaining cards of the pack, two cards are drawn at random (without replacement) and both are found to be spades. Find the probability of the lost card being a spade. 
\item In answering a question on a multiple choice questions with four choices in each question out of which only one is correct a student either guesses or copies or knows the answer. The probability that he makes a guess is $\dfrac{1}{4}$ and the probability that he copies is also $\dfrac{1}{4}$. The probability that the answer is correct given that he copied it is $\dfrac{3}{4}$. Find the probability that he knows the answer to the question given that he correctly answered it.
