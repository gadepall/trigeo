\item A card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of $52$ playing cards. The probability that the card will not be an ace is

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item $\dfrac{1}{13}$
    \item $\dfrac{1}{4}$
    \item $\dfrac{12}{13}$
    \item $\dfrac{3}{4}$
\end{enumerate}

A box contains 80 discs which are numbered from $1$ to $80$. If one disc is drawn at random from the box, find the probability that it bears a perfect square number.

\item Two dice are rolled once. Find the probability of getting such numbers on the two dice, whose product is $12$.


\item A ticket is drawn at random from a bag containing tickets numbered from $1$ to $40$. Find the probability that the selected ticket has a number which is a multiple of $5$.
\end{enumerate}
