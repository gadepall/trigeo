 \item The probability of selecting a red ball at random from a jar that contains only red, blue and orange balls is $\frac{1}{4}$ . The probability of selecting a blue ball at random from the same jar is $\frac{1}{3}$. If the jar contains $10$ orange balls, find the total number of balls in the jar.
