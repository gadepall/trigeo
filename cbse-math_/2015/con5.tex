     \item Construct a right triangle ABC with $AB$= $6$ cm, $BC$ = $8$ cm and $\angle$ B = 90$\degree$. Draw $BD$, the perpendicular from $B$ on AC. Draw the circle through $B$, $C$ and $D$ and construct the tangents from $A$to this circle

     \item Construct a $\triangle$ ABC in which  $AB$ = $6$ cm, $\angle$ A = $30\degree $ and $\angle$ B = $60\degree$. Construct another  $ AB'C'$ similar to $\triangle$ ABC with base AB'= $8$ cm.
