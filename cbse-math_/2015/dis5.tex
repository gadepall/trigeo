\begin{enumerate}
\item In an AP, if $S_5 + S_7$ = $167$ and $S_10$ = $235$, then find the AP, where $S_n$ denotes the sum of its first n terms.
\item The $14^{th}$ term of an AP is twice its $8^{th}$ term. If its $6^{ty}$ term is â€“ $8$, then find the sum of its first $20$ terms.
\item Find the 60th term of the AP $8, 10, 12, ...,$ if it has a total of 60 terms and hence find the sum of its last $10$ terms
\item The $16^{th}$ term of an {AP} is five times its third term. If its $10^{th}$ term is $41$, then find the sum of its firfifteen terms.
\end{enumerate}
