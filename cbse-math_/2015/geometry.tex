\item Due to sudden floods, some welfare associations jointly requested the government to get $100$ tents fixed immediately and offered to contribute $ 50\% $ of the cost. If the lower part of each tent is of the form of a cylinder of diameter $4.2$ m and height $4$ m with the conical upper part of same diameter but of height $2.8$ m, and the canvas to be used costs \rupee $100$ per sq. m, find the amount, the associations will have to pay.
