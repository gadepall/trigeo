\item A chord of a circle is equal to the radius of the
circle. Find the angle subtended by the chord at
a point on the minor arc and also at a point on the
major arc.
\item If diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral are diameters of the circle through the vertices of
the quadrilateral, prove that it is a rectangle.

are drawn to intersect the circles at $A, D$ and $P$,
$Q$ respectively. Prove that
$\angle ACP = \angle QCD$.
\item If circles are drawn taking two sides of a triangle as diameters, prove that the point of
intersection of these circles lie on the third side.
\item Prove that the line of centres of two intersecting circles subtends equal angles at the
two points of intersection.
\item Let the vertex of an angle $ABC$ be located outside a circle and let the sides of the angle
intersect equal chords $AD$ and $CE$ with the circle. Prove that $\angle ABC$ is equal to half the
difference of the angles subtended by the chords $AC$ and $DE$ at the centre.
\item Prove that the circle drawn with any side of a rhombus as diameter, passes through

necessary) at $E$. Prove that $AE = AD$.
