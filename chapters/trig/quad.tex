\item $O$ is any point inside a rectangle $ABCD$. Prove that $OB^2+OD^2 = OA^2+OC^2$.
\item $ABCD$ is a trapezium in which $AB  \parallel  DC$ and its diagonals intersect each other at the point $O$. Show
that
$\frac{AO}{ BO}=\frac{CO}{  DO}$
%
\item $PQRS$ and $ABRS$ are parallelograms and $X$ is any point on side $BR$. show that 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item $ar (PQRS) = ar (ABRS)$
\item $ar (AX S) = \frac{1}{ 2} ar (PQRS)$
\end{enumerate}
\item $ABCD$ is a quadrilateral and $BE  \parallel  AC$ and also $BE$ meets $DC$ produced at $E$. Show that area of $ \triangle  ADE$ is equal to the area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$.
\item  Diagonals of a trapezium $ABCD$ with $AB  \parallel  DC$ intersect each other at the point $O$. If $AB = 2 CD$, find the ratio of the areas of $\triangle s AOB$ and $COD$.
\item $ABCD$ is a quadrilateral and $BE  \parallel  AC$ and also $BE$ meets $DC$ produced at $E$. Show that area of $ \triangle  ADE$ is equal to the area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$.
\item Diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ of a quadrilateral $ABCD$ intersect each other at $P$. Show that $ar (APB)  \times  ar (CPD) = ar (APD)  \times  ar (BPC)$.
