The Bank of Oslo issues two types of coin: aluminium \brak{denoted \ A} and bronze \brak{denoted \ B}. Marianne has $n$ aluminium coins and $n$ bronze coins, arranged in a row in some arbitrary initial order. A chain is any subsequence of consecutive coins of the same type. Given a fixed positive integer $k$ $\leq$ $2n$, Marianne repeatedly performs the following operation: she identifies the longest chain containing the $k^{th}$  coin from the left, and movees all coins in that chain to the left end of the row. For example, if $n = 4$ and $k = 4$, the process starting from the ordering $AABBBABA$
 would be 
\begin{align}
A A \underline{B} B B A B A \rightarrow B B B \underline{A} A A B A \rightarrow A A \underline{A} B B B B A \rightarrow B B B \underline{B} A A A A \rightarrow .... 
\end{align}
Find all pairs \brak{n,k} with $\brak{1 \leq k \leq 2n }$ such that for every initial ordering, at some moment during the process, the leftmost \brak {n} coins will all be of the same type.

Let  $n$ be a positive integer. A Nordic square is an  $n \times n$ board containing all the integers from  $1$ to  $n^{2}$ so that each cell contains exactly one number. Two different cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Every cell that is adjacent only to cells containing la
Rger numbers is called a valley. An uphill path is a sequence of one or more cells such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The first cell in the sequence is a valley,
\item
Each subsequent cell in the sequence is adjacent to the previous cell, and
\item
The numbers written in the cells in the sequence are in increasing order.
\end{enumerate}
Find as a function of  $n$, the smallest possible total number of uphill paths in a Nordic square. \hfill(IMO 2022)

Let  $n$  be a positive integer. A $Japanese \ triangle$ consists of  $1 + 2 + \cdots + n$  circles arranged in an equilateral triangular shape such that for each  $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$  the  $i^{th}$ row contains exactly  $i$  circles, exactly one of which is coloured red. A ninja path in a $Japa
nese \ triangle$ is a sequence of  $n$  circles obtained by starting in the top row, then repeatedly going from a circle to one of the two circles immediately below it and finishing in the bottom row. Here is an example of a $Japanese \ triangle$ with $ n = 6$  along with a $ninja \ path$ in that tr
iangle containing two red circles.

Turbo the snail plays a game on a board with  $2024$ rows and  $2023$  columns. There  are hidden monsters in $2022$ of the cells. Initially, Turbo does not know where any of the monsters   are, but he knows that there Is exactly one monster in each row except the first row and the last  row, and 
That each column contains at most one monster.
Turbo makes a series of attempts to go from the first row to the last row. On each attempt, he chooses   to start on any cell in the first row, then repeatedly moves to an adjacent cell sharing a common Turbo the Tortoise is on a quest to escape from a rectangular grid of cells. Starting on any ce
