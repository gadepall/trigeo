\begin{enumerate}
\item How many two-digit positive integers $N$ have the property that the sum of $N$ and the number obtained by reversing the order of the digits of $N$ is a perfect square? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)

       \item Let $n$ be the largest integer that is the product of exactly 3 distinct prime numbers, $x$, $y$, and $10x + y$, where $x$ and $y$ are digits. What is the sum of the digits of $n$? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)

       \item A subset $B$ of the set of first 100 positive integers has the property that no two elements of $B$ sum to 125. What is the maximum possible number of elements in $B$?\hfill(PRERMO 2015)
