	\item A positive integer $n > 1$ is called beautiful if $n$ can be written in one and only one way as $n = a_{1} + a_{2} + \cdots + a_{k} = a_{1} \cdot a_{2} \cdots a_{k} $for some positive integers $a_{1},a_{2}, \cdots , a_{k}$ , where $k > 1$ and$ a_{1}  \geq a_{2} \geq \cdots \geq a_{k}$ . (For example $6$ is beautiful since$ 6 = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 3 + 2 + 1$ , and this is unique. But $8$ is not beautiful since $8 = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 $  as well as $8 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1$ , souniqueness is lost.)

	\item In the land of Binary, the unit of currency is called Ben and currency notes areavailable in denominations $1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, \cdots $ Bens. The rules of the Government of Binary stipulate that one can not use more than two notes of any one denomination in any transaction. For example, one can give a change for $2$ Bens in two ways: $2$ one Ben notes or $1$ two Ben note. For $5$ Ben one can give $1$ one Ben note and $1$ four Ben note or $1$ one Ben note and $2$ two Ben notes. Using $5$ one Ben notes or $3$ one Ben notes and $1$ two Ben notes for a $5$ Ben transaction is prohibited. Find the number of ways in which one can give change for $100$ Bens, following the rules of the Government.\hfill(IOQM 2015)
