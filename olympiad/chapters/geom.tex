    $ C $ is the midpoint of $ AB $, and $ D $ is the midpoint of arc $ AB $. Given that $ AB = 24 $ cm and $ CD = 6 $ cm, what is the radius of the plate in centimeters? (The figure is not drawn to scale.)\hfill(PRERMO 2015)

    \item A $ 2 \times 3 $ rectangle and a $ 3 \times 4 $ rectangle are contained within a square without overlapping at any interior point, and the sides of the square are parallel to the sides of the two given rectangles. What is the smallest possible area of the square? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)

    \item What is the greatest possible perimeter of a right-angled triangle with integer side lengths if one of the sides has length 12? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)

    \item In rectangle $ ABCD $, $ AB = 8 $ and $ BC = 20 $. Let $ P $ be a point on $ AD $ such that $ \angle BPC = 90\degree $. If $ r_1, r_2, r_3 $ are the radii of the incircles of triangles $ APB, BPC $, and $ CPD $, what is the value of $ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 $? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)


\item In the acute-angled triangle $ABC$, let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$, and $E$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Let $F$ be the midpoint of $AC$. Suppose $ \angle BAE = 40\degree $. If $ \angle DAE = \angle DFE $, what is the magnitude of $ \angle ADF $ in degrees?\hfill(PRERMO 2015)

\item The circle $ \omega $ touches the circle $ \Omega $ internally at $ P $. The center $ O $ of $ \Omega $ is outside $ \omega $. Let $XY$ be a diameter of $ \Omega $ which is also tangent to $ \omega $. Assume $ PY > PX $. Let $ PY $ intersect $ \omega $ at $ Z $. If $ YZ = 2PZ $, what is the magnitude of $ \angle LPYX $ in degrees? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)
