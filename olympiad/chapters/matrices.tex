\begin{enumerate}
\item A $n\times n$ matrix whose entires come from the set $S = \cbrak{1,2,\dots,2n-1}$ is called a silver matrix if, for each ${i=1,2,\dots,n,}$ the ith row and ith column together contain all elements of $S$. Show that                                     
\begin{enumerate}                        
	\item there is no silver matrix for $n=1997$;      
\item silver matrices exist for infinitely many values of $n$.\hfill(IMO 1997) 
\end{enumerate}
\item The positive integers $a$ and $b$ are such that the numbers $15a+16b$ and $16a-15b$ are both squares of positive integers. What is the least possible value that can be taken on by the smaller of these two squares?\hfill(IMO 1996)
\end{enumerate}
