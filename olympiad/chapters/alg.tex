    \item A man walks a certain distance and rides back in $ 3\frac{3}{4} $ hours; he could ride both ways in $ 2\frac{1}{2} $ hours. How many hours would it take him to walk both ways? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)

    \item Positive integers $a$ and $b$ are such that $ a + b = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a} $. What is the value of $ a^2 + b^2 $? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)

    \item The equations $ x^2 - 4x + k = 0 $ and $ x^2 + kx - 4 = 0 $, where $k$ is a real number, have exactly one common root. What is the value of $ k $? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)

    \item Let $P(x)$ be a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients. If $ P(n) $ is divisible by $n$ for each positive integer $n$, what is the value of $P(0)$? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)

    \item Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be real numbers such that $ a - 7b + 8c = 4 $ and $ 8a + 4b - c = 7 $. What is the value of $ a^2 - b^2 + c^2 $? \hfill(PRERMO 2015)

    \item Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be such that $a + b + c = 0$ and
