	A straight highway leads to the foot of a tower. A man standing on the top of the $75 {m}$ high tower observes two cars at angles of depression of $30\degree$ and $60\degree$, which are approaching the foot of the tower. If one car is exactky behind the other on the same side of the tower, find the distance between the two cars. Use \brak{\sqrt{3}=1.73}.
