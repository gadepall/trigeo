    \item A straight highway leads to the foot of a tower.A man standing on the top of the $75$ m high tower observes two cars at angles of depression of $30\degree$ and $60\degree$,Which are approaching the foot of the tower.If one car is exactly behind the other on the same side of the tower,find the distance between the two cars.
    \item From the top of a $7$ m high building, the angle of elevation of the top of a cable tower is $60\degree$ and the angle of depression of its foot is $30\degree$.Determine the height of the tower.(take $\sqrt{3}=1.73$)
    \item Governing council of local public development authority of Dehradun decided to build and adventurous playground on the top of a hill,Which will have adequate space for parking.
    After survey,it was decided to build rectangular playground,with a semi-circular area allocated for parking at one end of the playground.The length and breadth of the rectangular playground are $14$ units and $7$ units,respectively.There are two quadrants of radius $2$ units on one side for special seats:
