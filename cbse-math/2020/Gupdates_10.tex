\item A cone and a cylinder have the same radii but the height of the cone is $3$ times that of the cylinder. Find the ratio of their volumes.
\item In \figref{fig:Fig-8.png}, $ABCD$ is a parallelogram. A semicircle with centre $O$ and the diameter $AB$ has been drawn and it passes through $D$. If $AB=12cm$ and $OD \perp AB$, then find the area of the shaded region. (Use $\pi=3.14$)

\item A statue $1.6m$ tall, stands on the top of a pedestal. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of the statue is $60\degree$ and from the same point the angle of elevation of the top of the pedestal is $45\degree$. Find the height of the pedestal.(Use $\sqrt{3}=1.73$)
\item In a cylindrical vessel of radius $10 cm$, containing some water, $9000$ small spherical balls are dropped which are completely immersed in water which raises the water level. If each spherical ball is of radius $0.5 cm$, then find the rise in the level of water in the vessel.
\item If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides at distinct points, prove that the other two sides are divided in the same ratio.
\item If $\tan^{-1}\brak{\frac{y}{x}}=\log\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$, prove that $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x+y}{x-y}$.
