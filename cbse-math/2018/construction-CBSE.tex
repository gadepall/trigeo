\begin{enumerate}
	\item In an equilateral $\triangle$ ABC, D is a point on side BC such that $ BD =\frac{1}{3}BC$. Prove that $9(AD)^2 = 7(AB)^2$.
	\item Prove that, in a right triangle, the  square on the hypotenuse is equal to sum of the squares on the other two sides.
	\item Prove that the area of an equilateral triangle described on one side of the square is equal to half of the area of the equilateral triangle described on one of its diagonal.
	\item If the area of two similar triangles are equal, prove that they are congruent.
	\item Draw a triangle ABC with $BC=6 cm, AB=5 cm$ and $\angle{ABC}=60\degree$. Then construct a triangle whose sides are $\frac{3}{4}$ of the corresponding sides of the $\triangle ABC$.

	\item Given $\triangle ABC \sim  \triangle PQR$, if $\frac{AB}{PQ} = \frac{1}{3}$, then find $\frac{ar \triangle ABC}{ar \triangle PQR}$.
