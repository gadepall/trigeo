
\item A manufacturer has three machine operators A, B and C. The first operator A produces $1\%$ of defective items, whereas the other two operators B and C produces $5\%$ and $7\%$ defective items respectively. A is on the job for $50\%$ of the time, B on the job $30\%$ of the time and C on the job for $20\%$ of the time. All the items are put into one stockpile and then one item is chosen at random from this and is found to be defective. What is the probability that it was produced by A ?
\item The random variable $X$ has a probability distribution $P\brak{X}$ of the following form, where $k$ is some number:
\[P(X = x) = \begin{cases}
    k, & \text{if } x = 0 \\
    2k, & \text{if } x = 1 \\
    3k, & \text{if } x = 2 \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\] 
Determine the value of $k$.
\item Two cards are drawn simultaneously \brak{\text {or successively without replacement}} from a well shuffled pack of $52$ cards. Find the mean and variance of the number of kings.
\item A die marked $1, 2, 3$ in red and $4, 5, 6$ in green is tossed. Let $A$ be the event "number is even" and $B$ be the event "number is marked red." Find whether the events $A$ and $B$ are independent or not.
\item A die is thrown 6 times. If "getting an odd number" is a "success", what is the probability of:
\brak{i} 5 successes?
\brak{ii} at most 5 successes?
\end{enumerate}
