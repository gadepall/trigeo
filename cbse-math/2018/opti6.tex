\item A company produces two types of goods, $A$ and $B$, that require gold and silver. Each unit of type $A$ requires $3$g of silver and $1$g of gold, while that of type $B$ requires $1$g of silver and $2$g of gold. The company can use at most $9$g of silver and $8$g of gold. If each unit of type $A$ brings a profit of \rupee $40$ and that of type $B$ \rupee $50$, find the number of units of each type that the company should produce to maximize profit. Formulate the above Linear Programming Problem $\brak{LPP}$ and solve it graphically. Also, find the maximum profit.
