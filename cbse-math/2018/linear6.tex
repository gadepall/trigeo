\item If the line $\dfrac{x-1}{-3} = \dfrac{y-2}{2\lambda} = \dfrac{z-3}{2} $ and $\dfrac{x-1}{3\lambda} = \dfrac{y-1}{2}  = \dfrac{z-6}{-5} $ are perpendicular, find the value of $\lambda$. Hence find whether the lines are intersecting or not.
  \item Find the equation of the line passing through $\brak{2,-1, 2}$ and $\brak{5, 3, 4}$ and of the plane passing through $\brak{2, 0, 3}$, $\brak{1, 1, 5}$ and $\brak{3, 2, 4}$. Also, find their point of intersection.
