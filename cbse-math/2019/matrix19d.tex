 \item If $A$ is a square matrix of order $3$, with $\abs{A} = 9$, then write the value of $\abs{2.\,\text{adj}A}$.

     \item If $A$ and $B$ are symmertic matrices, such that $AB$ and $BA$ are both defined, then prove that $AB-BA$ is a skew matrix.

    \item Using properties of determinants, find the value of $x$ for which
    \begin{align*}
        \mydet{4-x&4+x&4+x\\4+x&4-x&4+x\\4+x&4+x&4-x}=0.
    \end{align*}
