\begin{enumerate}

\item A boy standing on a horizontal plane finds a bird flying at a distance of $100 m$ from him at an elevation of $30\degree$. A girl standing on the roof of a $20 m$ high building, finds the elevation of the same bird to be $45\degree$. The boy and the girl are on the opposite sides of the bird. Find the distance of the bird from the girl. (Given ${\sqrt 2}= 1.414$)

\item The angle of elevation of an aeroplane from a point $A$ on the ground is $60\degree$. After a flight of $30 $seconds , the angle of elevation changes to $30\degree$. If the plane is flying at a constant height of $3600\sqrt 3 $ metres, find the speed of the aeroplane.

\end{enumerate}
