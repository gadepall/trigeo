\begin{enumerate}
\item Using method of integration, find the area of the region enclosed between two circles ${x^2+y^2=4}$ and $\brak{x-2}^2+{y^2}=4$.

\item Find the equation of the normal to the curve ${x}^2 = 4y$ which passes through the point $\myvec{-1,4}$.

\item Find the point on the curve ${y}^2 = 4x$, which is nearest to the point $\myvec{2,-8}$.
