\item Prove that the relation $R$ in the set $A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$ given by $R$=$\brak{a,b} : \abs{a-b}$ is even, is an equivalence relation.

\item Show that the function $f$ in $A=R-\{\dfrac{2}{3}\}$ defined as $f(x)=\dfrac{4x+3}{6x-4}$ is one-one and onto. Hence find $f^{-1}$. 

\item Find whether the function $f(x)=\cos\brak{2x+\dfrac{\pi}{4}}$ is increasing or decreasing in the interval $\dfrac{3\pi}{8}<x<\dfrac{5\pi}{8}$.

\item If an operation on the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is defined by $a*b=2a^2+b$, then find $(i)$ whether it is binary or not and $(ii)$ If a binary  then is it commutative or not.
