\item Let $X$ be a random variable which assumes values $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ such that 
\begin{align*}
2P\brak{X = x_1} = 3P\brak{X = x_2} = P\brak{X = x_3} = 5P\brak{X = x_4}.
\end{align*}
Find the probability distribution of $X$.

\item Mother, father and son line up at random for a family photo. If $A$ and $B$ are two events given by $A$ = Son on one end, $B$ = Father in the middle, find $P(B\mid A)$.

\item A coin is tossed $5$ times. Find the probability of getting \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item  at least $4$ heads
    \item at most $4$ heads.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item There are two boxes I and II. Box I contains $3$ red and $6$ black balls. Box II contains $5$ red and $'n'$ black balls. One of the two boxes, box I and box I is selected at random and a ball is drawn at random. The ball drawn is found to be red. If the probability that this red ball comes out from box I is $\dfrac{3}{5}$,find the value of $'n'$.

\item Find the mean and variance of the random variable $X$ which denotes the number of doublets in four throws of a pair of dice.
