\item Let an operation *on the set of natural number $N$ be defined by $a*b=a^b$. Find $\brak{i}$ where the *is a binary or not and $\brak{ii}$ if it is a binary, then is it commutative or not. 
\item Find whether the function $f\brak{x}=\cos\brak{2x+\dfrac{\pi}{4}}$; is increasing or decreasing in the interval $\dfrac{3\pi}{8}<x<\dfrac{5\pi}{8}.$  

\item Find the interval in which the function $f$ given by \begin{align*}
f\brak{x}=\sin2x+\cos2x, 0\leq x\leq \pi \end{align*} is strictly decreasing.
