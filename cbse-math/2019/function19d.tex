  \item Let $*$ be an operation defined as $*$: $\textbf{R}\times\textbf{R}\rightarrow \textbf{R} $ such that $a * b = 2a + b,\,a$, $b\in \textbf{R} $ . Check if * is a binary operation. If yes, find if it is associative too.

    \item Let $A$ = $R-\cbrak{2}$ and $B=R\cbrak{1}$. If $f: A\overrightarrow{}  B$ is a function defined by $f\brak{x}$=$\dfrac{x-1}{x-2}$, show that $f$ is one-one and onto. Hence, find $f^{-1}$.

    \item Show that the relation $S$ in the set $A = \cbrak{x \in Z : 0 \leq x \leq 12}$ given by $S = \cbrak{(a,\hspace{6pt}b) : a,\,{6pt}b \in Z,\hspace{6pt}\abs{a-b}}$ is divisible by $3$ is an equivalence relation.

    \item Let $* : N \times N$ $\rightarrow N $ be an operation defined as $a * b = a + ab, \,\forall a,\,b \in N $. Check if * is a binary operation. If yes, find if it is associative too.
