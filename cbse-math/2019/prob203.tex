\item If $P\brak{A}=0.6, P\brak{B}=0.5$ and $P\brak{\dfrac{B}{A}}=0.4$ find $P\brak{A \cup B}$ and $P\brak{\dfrac{A}{B}}$.

\item Four cards are drawn one by one with replacement from a well-shuffled deck of playing cards. Find the probability that at least three cards are diamonds.

\item The Probability of two students $A$ and $B$ coming to school on time are $\dfrac{2}{7}$ and $\dfrac{4}{7}$ respectively, Assuming that the events '$A$ coming on time' and '$B$ coming on time' are independent find the probability of only one of them coming to school on time.

\item If $A$ and $B$ are independent events with $P(A)=\dfrac{3}{7}$ and $P(B)=\dfrac{2}{5}$, then find $P(A' \cap B')$
