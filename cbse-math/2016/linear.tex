\begin{enumerate}

	      $B\myvec{4, 2, -2}$ and $C\myvec{6, 5, -1}$ and hence find the value of$\lambda$ for which
	      $A\myvec{3, 2 , 1}$, $B\myvec{4 , 2 , -2}$, $C\myvec{6 , 5 , -1}$ and $D\myvec{\lambda , 5 , 5}$
	      are coplanar.

	\item Find the equation of the plane containing two parallel lines
	      $\frac{x-1}{2} = \frac{y+1}{-1} = \frac{z}{3}$ and $\frac{x}{4} = \frac{y-2}{-2} = \frac{z+1}{6}$
	      Also, find if the plane thus obtained contains the line
	      $\frac{x-2}{3} =\frac{y-1}{1} = \frac{z-2}{5}$ or not.



	\item For what value of $k$, the system of linear equations
	      \begin{align*}
		      x+y+z    & = 2 \\
		      2x+y-z   & =3  \\
		      3x+2y+kz & =4
	      \end{align*}

	\item Show that the four points $A(4,5,1)$, $ B(0,-1,-1)$,
	      $C(3,9,4)$ and $D(-4,4,4)$ are coplanar.

	\item Find the coordinates of the foot of perpendicular drawn from the point
	      $A(-1, 8, 4)$ to the line joining the points $B(0, -1, 3)$ and $C(2,-3,-1)$. Hence
	      find the image of the point $A$ in the line $BC$.
	\item For what values of $k$, the system of linear equations\\
	      $x+y+z=2$\\
	      $2x+y-z=3$\\
	      $3x+2y+kz=4$\\
	      has a unique solution?
	\item Show that the lines $\frac{x-1}{3} = \frac{y-1}{-1} = \frac{z+1}{0} $ and $\frac{x-4}{2} = \frac{y}{0} = \frac{z+1}{3} $ intersect.Find their point of intersection.
