\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a circle of radius $4$ cm. Draw two tangents to the circle inclined at an angle of $ 60 \degree $ to each other.\\
\item Draw a triangle with sides $5$ cm, $6$ cm and $7$ cm. Then draw another triangle whose sides are $\dfrac{4}{5}$ of the corresponding sides of first triangle.\\
\item Draw an isosceles $\triangle ABC$ in which $BC=5.5 cm$ and altitude $AL=5.3 cm$. Then construct another triangle whose sides are $\dfrac{3}{4}$ of the corresponding sides of $\triangle ABC$.
\end{enumerate}
