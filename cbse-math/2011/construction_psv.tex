\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw a line segment of length 6 cm. Using compasses and ruler, find a point P on it which divides it in the ratio $3:4$.
    \item Draw a triangle ABC in which AB=5 cm, BC=6 cm and $\angle ABC=60^\circ$. Then construct a triangle whose sides are $\dfrac{5}{7}$ times the corresponding sides of $\triangle ABC$.
\end{enumerate}
