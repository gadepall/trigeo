    \item The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point on the ground, which is 30 m away from the foot of the tower is 45Â°. The height of the tower (in metres) is
    \hfill\brak{10, 2011}\item From the top of a tower $100$ $m$ high, a man observes two cars on the opposite sides of the tower with angles of depression $30^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ respectively. Find the distance between the cars. [Use $\sqrt{3}=1.73$].
    \hfill\brak{10, 2011}\item Two poles of equal heights are standing opposite to each other on either side of the road, which is $100m$ wide. From a point between them on the road, the angles of elevation of the top of the poles are $60^\circ$ and $30^\circ$, respectively. Find the height of the poles.
