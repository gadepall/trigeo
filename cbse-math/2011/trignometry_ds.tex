\item A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground which is $25$ m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is found to be $45\degree$. Then the height $\brak{in\,meters}$ of the tower is



\hfill\brak{10, 2011}\item The angle of elevation of the top of a vertical tower from a point on the ground is $60\degree$. From another point $10$ m vertically above the first, its angle of elevation is $30\degree$. Find the height of the tower.


\hfill\brak{10, 2011}\item From the top of a vertical tower, the angles of depression of two cars, in the same straight line with the base of the tower, at an instant are found to be $45\degree$ and $60\degree$. If the cars are $100$ m apart and are on the same side of the tower, find the height of the tower. 

[Use $\sqrt{3} = 1.73$]
