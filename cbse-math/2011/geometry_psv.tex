\begin{enumerate}
    \item A sphere of diameter 18 cm is dropped into a cylindrical vessel of diameter 36 cm, partly filled with water. If the sphere is completely submerged, then the water level rises (in cm) by

        \item 3
        \item 4 
        \item 5
        \item 6

    \item Two cubes, each of side 4 cm are joined end to end. Find the surface area of the resulting cuboid.
    \item Find that value(s) of x for which the distance between the points $P(x,4)$ and $Q(9,10)$ is $10$units.
    \item From a solid cylinder whose height is 15 cm and diameter 16 cm, a conical cavity of the same height and same diameter is hollowed out. Find the total surface area of the remaining solid. [Take $n=3.14$]
