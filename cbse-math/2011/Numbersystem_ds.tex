\begin{enumerate}
\item Find how many two-digit numbers are divisible by $6$.
 How many multiples of $4$ lie between $10$ and $250$ ? Also find their sum.
  

\item If $P\left(\dfrac{a}{2},4\right)$ is the midpoint of the line-segment joining the points $A(-6, 5)$ and $B(-2, 3)$, then the value of $a$ is

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item $-8$
    \item $3$
    \item $-4$
    \item $4$
\end{enumerate}
\item Draw a line segment $AB$ of length $7$ cm. Using ruler and compasses, find a point $P$ on $AB$ such that $\dfrac{AP}{AB} = \dfrac{3}{5}$.
