\item If $A$ and $B$ are the points $(-6, 7)$ and $(-1, -5)$ respectively, then the distance $2AB$ is equal to

  \begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item $13$
    \item $26$
    \item $169$
    \item $238$
  \end{enumerate}

\item Point $P(x, 4)$ lies on the line segment joining the points $A (-5,8)$ and $B (4, -10)$. Find the ratio in which point $P$ divides the line segment $AB$. Also, find the value of $x$.

\item Find the area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$, whose vertices are $A(-3, -1)$, $B(-2, -4)$, $C(4, -1)$, and $D(3, 4)$.

\item Find the value of $y$ for which the distance between the points $A(3, -1)$ and $B(11, y)$ is $10$ units.
