\item Write the distance of the following plane from the origin:
    \begin{align*}
    2x - y + 2z + 1 = 0
    \end{align*}

\item Find the points on the line $\frac{x+2}{3} = \frac{y+1}{2} = \frac{z-3}{2}$ at a distance of 5 units from the point $P\brak{1, 3, 3}$.

\item Find the distance of the point $P\brak{6, 5, 9}$ from the plane determined by the points $A\brak{3, -1, 2}$, $B\brak{5, 2, 4}$ and $C\brak{-1, -1, 6}$.

\item Find the coordinates of the foot of the perpendicular and the perpendicular distance of the point $P\brak{3, 2, 1}$ from the plane $2x - y + z + 1 = 0$. Find also, the image of the point in the plane.

\item Find the area of the circle $4x^2 + 4y^2 = 9$ which is interior to the parabola $x^2 = 4y$.

\item Using integration, find the area of the triangle ABD, coordinates of whose vertices are A(4, 1), B(6, 6) and C(8, 4).

\item If the length of three sides of a trapezium other than the base is 10cm each, find the area of the trapezium, when it is maximum.
