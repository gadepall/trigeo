\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the value of $p$, for which one root of the equation 
\begin{align*}
	px^2-14x+8=0
\end{align*}
is $6$ times the other.
\item If the roots of the equation
\begin{align*}
	\brak{c^2-ab}x^2-2\brak{a^2-bc}x+b^2-ac=0 
\end{align*}
in x are equal, then show that either a=0 or 
\begin{align*}
	a^3+b^3+c^3=3abc.
\end{align*}
\item Solve for x:
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{1}{2x-3}+\dfrac{1}{x-5}=1\dfrac{1}{9}, x\neq\dfrac{3}{2},5 
\end{align*}
\item A train covers a distance of $300$ km at a uniform speed. If the speed of the train is increased by $5$ km/hour, it takes $2$ hours less in the journey. Find the original speed of the  train.
\item If $ad \neq bc$, then prove that the equation $\brak{a^2 + b^2}x^2 + 2\brak{ac +bd}x + \brak{c^2 + d^2} = 0 $ has no real root.
\item Solve for x :
 \begin{align*}
 \dfrac{1}{1+x} + \dfrac{3}{5x+1} = \dfrac{5}{x+4} , 
 x \neq -1, \dfrac{-1}{5}, -4
\end{align*}
\item If the roots of the equation $\brak{a^2 + b^2}$ $x^{2} - 2\brak{ac + bd}$ x + $\brak{c^2 +d^2}$ = 0 are equal, prove that $\dfrac {a}  {b}$ =$\dfrac {c}  {d}$.

\item solve for X :
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{X-1}{2X+1}  +  \dfrac{2X+1}{X-1} =2 ,  where x  \neq  \dfrac{-1}{2}
\end{align*}
\item $A$ takes $6$ days less than $B$ to do a work. If both $A$ and $B$ working together can do it in 4 days, how many days will $B$ take to finish it ?
\item Two taps running together can fill a tank in $3\dfrac{1}{13}$ hours. If one tap takes $3$ hours more than the other to fill the tank, then how much time will each tap take to fill the tank ?
