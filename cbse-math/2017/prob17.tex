\begin{enumerate}
\item A die,whose faces are marked  $1, 2, 3 $ in red and $4,5,6 $ in green, is tossed . Let A be the event “number obtained is even” and B be the event “number obtained is red" . Find if A and B are independent events.
\item There are $4$ cards numbered $1, 3, 5 \text{ and }  7,$  one number on one card . Two cards are drawn at random without replacement . Let $X$ denote the sum of the numbers on the two drawn cards . Find the mean and variance of $X$ .
\item Of the students in a school, it is known that $30\%$ have $100\%$ attendance and $70\%$ students are irregular . Previous year results report that $70\%$ of all students who have $100\%$ attendance attain A grade and $10\%$ irregular students attain A grade in their annual examination . At the end of the year, one student is chosen at random from the school and he was found to have an A grade . What is the probability that the student has $100\%$ attendance ? Is regularity required only in school ? Justify your answer .
