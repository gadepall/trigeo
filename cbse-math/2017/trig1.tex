\begin{enumerate}
\item If a tower $30$ m high, casts a shadow $10\sqrt{3}$ m long on a ground, then what is the angle of elevation of the sun ?
\item A man observes a car from the top of a tower, which is  moving towards the tower with a uniform speed. If the angle of depression of the car changes from $30\degree$ to $45\degree$ in $12$ minutes, find the time taken by the car now to reach the tower.
\item An aeroplane is flying at a height of $300 m$ above the ground. Flying at this height, the angles of depression from the aeroplane of two points on both banks of a river in opposite directions are $45\degree$ and $60\degree$ respectively. Find the width of the river. 
\hfill $\sbrak{Use \sqrt 3 = 1.732}$
\item On a straight line passing through the foot of a tower, two points $C$$D$ are at distances of $4$ m
and $16$ m from the foot respectively. If the angles of elevation from$C$$D$ of the top tower are complementary, then find the height of the tower.  
\item From the top of a tower, $100$ m high, a man observes two cars on the opposite sides of the tower and in same straight line with its base, with angles of depression $30\degree$ and $45\degree$. Find the distance between the cars.
\hfill  $\sbrak{Take \sqrt{3} = 1.732}$
