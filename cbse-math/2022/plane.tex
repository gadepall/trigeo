	\item Find the equation of the plane passing through the points $(2,1,0),(3,-2,-2)$ and $(1,1,7)$. Also, obtain its distance from the origin.

	\item The foot of a perpendicular drawn from the point $(-2,-1,-3)$ on a plane is $(1,-3,3)$. Find the equation of the plane.

	\item Find the cartesian and the vector equation of a plane which passes through the point $(3,2,0)$ and contains the line $\dfrac{x-3}{1}=\dfrac{y-6}{5}=\dfrac{z-4}{4}$.

	\item The distance between the planes $4x-4y+2z+5=0$ and $2x-2y+z+6=0$ is

		\begin{enumerate}

			\item $\dfrac{1}{6}$
			\item $\dfrac{7}{6}$
			\item $\dfrac{11}{6}$
			\item $\dfrac{16}{6}$
		\end{enumerate}

	\item Find the equation of the plane through the line of intersection of the planes
		\begin{align}
			\vec{r}\cdot(\hat{i}+3\hat{j})+6&=0\\\vec{r}\cdot(3\hat{i}-\hat{j}-4\hat{k})&=0
		\end{align}which is at a  unit distance from the origin.
