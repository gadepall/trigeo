\begin{enumerate}
\item A manufacturer produces nuts and bolts. It takes $2$ hours work on machine $A$ and $3$ hours work on machine $B$ to produce a package of nuts. It takes $3$ hours on machine $A$ and $2$ hours on machine $B$ to produce a package of bolts. He earns a profit of \rupee $24$ per package on nuts and \rupee 18 per package on bolts. How many packages of each should be produced each day so as to maximize his profit, if he operates his machines for at the most $10$ hours a day. Make an L.P.P. from above and solve it graphically.
\end{enumerate}
