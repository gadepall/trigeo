\begin{enumerate}
\item In the interval ${\pi}/2<x<\pi$, find the value of $x$ for which the matrix $\myvec{2\sin{x} & 3 \\ 1 & 2\sin{x}}$ is singular.

\item Express the matrix $A = \myvec{2&4&-6\\7&3&5\\1&-2&4}$ as the sum of a symmetric and skew symmetric matrix. 

\item A trust fund has \rupee $35,000$ is to be invested in two different types of bonds. The first bond pays $8\%$ interest per annum which will be given to orphanage and second bond pays $10\%$ interest per annum which will be given to an N.G.O. (Cancer Aid Society). Using matrix multiplication, determine how to divide \rupee $35,000$ among two types of bonds if the trust fund obtains an annual total interest of \rupee $3,200$. What are the values reflected in this question? 

\item If $A = \myvec{2&3\\1&-4}, B = \myvec{1&-2\\-1&3}$, verify that $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$. 

\item Using properties of determinant, solve for $x$:
$\mydet{a+x & a-x & a-x \\ a-x & a+x & a-x \\ a-x & a-x & a+x} = 0$ 
\end{enumerate}
