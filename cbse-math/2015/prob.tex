\begin{enumerate}
\item Four cards are drawn successively with replacement from a well shuffled deck of $52$ cards. What is the probability that
\begin{enumerate}
\item all the four cards are spades?
\item only $2$ cards are spades?
\end{enumerate}

\item A pair of dice is thrown $4$ times, If getting a doublet is considered a success, find the probabbility distribution of number of successes. Hence find the mean of the distribution. 

\item In answering a question on a multiple choice test, a student either knows the answer or guesses. Let $\frac{3}{5}$ be the probability that he knows the answer and $\frac{2}{5}$ be the probability that he guesses. Assuming that a student who gusses at the answer will be correct with probability $\frac{1}{3}$, what is the probability that the student knows the answer given that he answered it correctly?
