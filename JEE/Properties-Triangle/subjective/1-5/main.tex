     \item A triangle $ABC$ has sides $AB=AC=5 cm$ and $BC =6 cm$. Triangle $A'B'C'$ is the reflection of the triangle $ABC$ in a line parallel to $AB$ placed at a distance of $2$ cm from $AB$, outside the triangle $ABC$. Triangle $A"B"C"$ is the reflection of the triangle $A'B'C'$ in a line parallel $B'C'$ placed at a distance of $2 cm$ from $B'C'$ outside the triangle $A'B'C'$. Find the distance between $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{A'}$.\hfill {(1978)}
     \item 
     \begin{enumerate}
     	\item If a circle is inscribed in a right angled triangle $ABC$ right angled at $\vec{B}$, show that the diameter of the circle is equal to $AB+BC-AC$.
     	\item If a triangle is inscribed in a circle, then the product of any two sides of the triangle is equal to the product of the diameter and perpendicular distance of the third side from the opposite vertex. Prove the above statement.

     \item
     \begin{enumerate}
     	\item A baloon is observed simultaneously from three points $\vec{A},\vec{B} \text{ and } \vec{C}$ on a straight road directly beneath it. The angular elevation at $\vec{B}$ is twice that at $\vec{A}$ and angular elevation at $\vec{C}$ is thrice that of $\vec{A}$. If the distance between $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ is $a$ and the distance between $\vec{B}$ and $\vec{C}$ is $b$, find height of baloon in terms of $a \text{ and } b$.
     	\item Find the area of the smaller part of a disc of radius $10 cm$, cut off by a chord $AB$ which subtends an angle of $22\frac{1}{2} \degree$ at the circumference.
     \end{enumerate}
     \hfill {(1980)}
     \item $ABC$ is a triangle. $\vec{D}$ is the middle point of $BC$. If $AD$ is perpendicular to $AC$, then prove that $\cos{A}\cos{C} = \frac{2(c^{2}-a^{2}}{3ac}$.
     \hfill {(1980)}
     \item $ABC$ is a triangle with $AB=AC$. $\vec{D}$ is any point on the side $BC$. $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{F}$ are points on the side $AB \text{ and } AC$, respectively, such that $DE$ is parallel to $AC, \text{ and } DF$ is parallel to $AB$. Prove that \\
     $DF + FA + AE + ED = AB+AC$
